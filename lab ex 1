# Communication, Study of Cables and Its Color Codes

## Objective:
- To introduce Packet Tracer and its basic features.
- To understand peer-to-peer communication.
- To study different types of network cables and their color codes.

## Materials Required:
- Packet Tracer software.
- Network cables (Ethernet, crossover, etc.).

## Theory:
- **Overview of Packet Tracer**: Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool that allows users to create network topologies, configure devices, and simulate packet flows.
- **Basics of Peer-to-Peer Communication**: This involves direct communication between two devices without a centralized server, allowing for efficient data exchange.
- **Color Coding Standards for Network Cables**:
  - **Ethernet Cable**: T568A and T568B standards.
    - T568A: White/Green, Green, White/Orange, Blue, White/Blue, Orange, White/Brown, Brown.
    - T568B: White/Orange, Orange, White/Green, Blue, White/Blue, Green, White/Brown, Brown.

## Procedure:
1. **Open Packet Tracer**: Launch the software and explore its interface.
2. **Create a Simple Network**:
   - Drag two computers and a switch into the workspace.
   - Connect the computers to the switch using Ethernet cables.
3. **Configure IP Addresses**:
   - Click on each computer and navigate to the Desktop tab â†’ IP Configuration.
   - Assign the following IP addresses:
     - Computer 1: `192.168.1.1` (Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`)
     - Computer 2: `192.168.1.2` (Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`)
4. **Test the Connection**:
   - Open the Command Prompt on Computer 1 and use the ping command:
     ```plaintext
     ping 192.168.1.2
     ```
   - Check for successful replies.
5. **Study Network Cables**:
   - Review the different types of cables (Ethernet, crossover) and their respective color codes.

## Observations:
- **IP Configuration Steps**:
  - Documented IP addresses assigned to each computer.
- **Ping Results**:
  - Record successful ping results, indicating proper connectivity.
- **Cable Color Codes**:
  - T568A: 
    - White/Green, Green, White/Orange, Blue, White/Blue, Orange, White/Brown, Brown.
  - T568B: 
    - White/Orange, Orange, White/Green, Blue, White/Blue, Green, White/Brown, Brown.

## Conclusion:
- Summarized the steps taken to create the network and configure devices.
- Reflected on the importance of understanding basic networking concepts, including IP addressing and the significance of different cable types and their color codes.

# Lab 2: Implementation of Network Topologies

## Objective:
- To implement and understand different network topologies.

## Materials Required:
- Packet Tracer software.

## Theory:
- **Overview of Various Network Topologies**:
  - **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line. Easy to set up but can lead to data collisions.
  - **Star Topology**: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Easy to manage and troubleshoot, but if the central device fails, the whole network goes down.
  - **Ring Topology**: Each device is connected to two others, forming a ring. Data travels in one direction, reducing collisions but can be disrupted if one device fails.
  - **Mesh Topology**: Each device is connected to every other device. Provides high redundancy and reliability but is complex and costly to implement.
  - **Hybrid Topology**: A combination of two or more topologies. Flexible and scalable but can be complicated to design and manage.

## Procedure:
1. **Open Packet Tracer**: Launch the software and explore its interface.
2. **Implement a Bus Topology**:
   - Place at least three devices (computers) and connect them using a single cable segment.
3. **Implement a Star Topology**:
   - Place at least three devices and connect them to a central switch.
4. **Implement a Ring Topology**:
   - Place at least three devices and connect them in a circular manner.
5. **Implement a Mesh Topology**:
   - Place at least three devices and connect each device to every other device.
6. **Test the Connections**:
   - Use the ping command to test connectivity between devices in each topology.

## Observations:
- **Document the Setup**: 
  - Provide screenshots of each topology.
- **Ping Results**:
  - Record successful ping results for each topology to demonstrate connectivity.

## Conclusion:
- **Summarize the Characteristics and Differences of Each Topology**:
  - **Bus Topology**: Simple and cost-effective, but limited in scale.
  - **Star Topology**: Most common in modern networks due to ease of management.
  - **Ring Topology**: Efficient but vulnerable to device failure.
  - **Mesh Topology**: Offers high redundancy but is complex.
  - **Hybrid Topology**: Combines the benefits of multiple topologies, making it versatile for various networking needs.

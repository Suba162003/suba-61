# Lab 3: Router Configuration (Creating Passwords, Configuring Interfaces)

## Objective:
- To configure a router by setting up passwords and interfaces.

## Materials Required:
- Packet Tracer software.

## Theory:
- **Basics of Router Configuration**: Involves setting up a router to manage network traffic, including configuring interfaces and security settings.
- **Importance of Securing Router Access**: Properly securing router access is crucial to protect the network from unauthorized access and potential attacks.

## Procedure:
1. **Open Packet Tracer**: Launch the software and create a new workspace.
2. **Create a Network**:
   - Add a router and two computers to the workspace.
   - Connect the computers to the router using appropriate cables.
3. **Access the Router's CLI**:
   - Click on the router and select the CLI tab.
4. **Set Up Passwords**:
   - Configure console password:
     ```plaintext
     enable
     configure terminal
     line console 0
     password your_console_password
     login
     ```
   - Configure enable password:
     ```plaintext
     enable secret your_enable_password
     ```
   - Configure VTY password:
     ```plaintext
     line vty 0 4
     password your_vty_password
     login
     ```
5. **Configure Router Interfaces**:
   - Assign IP addresses to the router interfaces:
     ```plaintext
     interface gig0/0
     ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown
     
     interface gig0/1
     ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown
     ```
6. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Configure the IP addresses on the computers:
     - Computer 1: `192.168.1.2` (Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`)
     - Computer 2: `192.168.2.2` (Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`)
   - Use the ping command from each computer to test connectivity through the router.

## Observations:
- **Document the Configuration Steps**:
  - Provide a summary of the commands used for configuration.
- **Test Results**:
  - Record successful ping results between the two computers to confirm connectivity.

## Conclusion:
- **Reflect on the Importance of Securing and Configuring Routers Properly**:
  - Proper router configuration is essential for network security and functionality. Setting strong passwords helps prevent unauthorized access and protects the integrity of the network.

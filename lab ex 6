# Lab 6: NAT Configuration

## Objective:
- To configure Network Address Translation (NAT).

## Materials Required:
- Packet Tracer software.

## Theory:
- **Overview of NAT**: Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method used to translate private (non-routable) IP addresses to a public IP address before packets are forwarded to an external network. It helps conserve IP addresses and provides an additional layer of security.
- **Importance of NAT**: NAT allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address, making it essential for home and corporate networks.

## Procedure:
1. **Create a Network**:
   - Design a network in Packet Tracer that includes an internal segment (using private IP addresses) and an external segment (using public IP addresses).
  
2. **Configure NAT on the Router**:
   - Access the router's CLI and configure NAT. This involves:
     - Defining the internal network (inside) and the external network (outside).
     - Configuring NAT overload (PAT) to allow multiple internal IPs to be mapped to a single public IP.
     ```plaintext
     enable
     configure terminal
     interface gig0/0
     ip nat inside
     
     interface gig0/1
     ip nat outside
     
     ip nat inside source list [access-list-number] interface gig0/1 overload
     
     access-list [access-list-number] permit [private_IP_range]
     ```

3. **Test Connectivity**:
   - From a device in the internal segment, attempt to access an external site (e.g., using ping or a web browser) to verify that NAT is functioning correctly.

## Observations:
- **Document the NAT Configuration Steps**:
  - Include all commands used to configure NAT and any necessary access lists.
  
- **Test Results**:
  - Record successful tests of connectivity from internal devices to the external network.

## Conclusion:
- **Summarize the Benefits and Working of NAT**:
  - NAT effectively conserves IP addresses by allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address. It enhances security by hiding internal IP addresses and is essential for the functionality of many private networks.

# Lab 4: IP Addressing and Subnetting (VLSM)

## Objective:
- To understand and implement IP addressing and Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM).

## Materials Required:
- Packet Tracer software.

## Theory:
- **Basics of IP Addressing and Subnetting**: IP addressing is a method used to identify devices on a network. Subnetting divides a network into smaller, manageable segments.
- **Overview of VLSM**: Variable Length Subnet Masking allows for subnets of different sizes to be created, optimizing the use of IP addresses.

## Procedure:
1. **Design a Network**:
   - Create a network layout in Packet Tracer that includes multiple subnets based on the requirements of your scenario.
  
2. **Calculate the Subnets Using VLSM**:
   - Start with a given IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
   - Determine the number of hosts required for each subnet.
   - Calculate the subnet masks for each subnet to accommodate the required hosts.
  
3. **Assign IP Addresses**:
   - Assign IP addresses to devices in each subnet based on the calculated ranges.
   - Example:
     - Subnet 1: `192.168.1.0/26` (Hosts: 62)
     - Subnet 2: `192.168.1.64/27` (Hosts: 30)
     - Subnet 3: `192.168.1.96/28` (Hosts: 14)
  
4. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Use the ping command to test connectivity between devices located in different subnets.

## Observations:
- **Document the Subnet Calculations**:
  - Include the subnet mask, network address, and valid host ranges for each subnet.
  
- **Test Results**:
  - Record the successful ping results to verify connectivity between devices in different subnets.

## Conclusion:
- **Summarize the Process and Importance of Proper IP Addressing and Subnetting**:
  - Proper IP addressing and subnetting using VLSM optimizes the use of IP addresses, reduces waste, and enhances network performance. Understanding these concepts is critical for effective network design and management.

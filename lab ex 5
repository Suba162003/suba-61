# Lab 5: Static and Default Routing

## Objective:
- To configure and understand static and default routing.

## Materials Required:
- Packet Tracer software.

## Theory:
- **Basics of Routing**: Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic. Routers use routing tables to determine the best path for data packets.
- **Differences Between Static and Default Routing**:
  - **Static Routing**: Manual configuration of routes by the network administrator. Routes do not change unless manually updated.
  - **Default Routing**: A route that is used when there is no specific match found in the routing table. It provides a path to unknown destinations.

## Procedure:
1. **Create a Network**:
   - Design a network in Packet Tracer with at least two routers and several devices connected to each router.
  
2. **Configure Static Routes**:
   - On Router 1, configure static routes to reach networks behind Router 2.
     ```plaintext
     enable
     configure terminal
     ip route [destination_network] [subnet_mask] [next_hop_ip]
     ```
   - On Router 2, configure static routes to reach networks behind Router 1.
  
3. **Configure a Default Route**:
   - On Router 1, configure a default route pointing to Router 2:
     ```plaintext
     ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [next_hop_ip]
     ```

4. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Use the ping command from devices connected to each router to verify connectivity across the network.

## Observations:
- **Document the Routing Configurations**:
  - Include the commands used for static and default routing configurations.
  
- **Test Results**:
  - Record the successful ping results to demonstrate connectivity between devices across the routers.

## Conclusion:
- **Reflect on the Differences and Use Cases of Static and Default Routing**:
  - Static routing is useful for small, stable networks where routes do not change often. Default routing simplifies the routing table and is useful for directing traffic to unknown networks. Understanding these routing methods is essential for effective network management.

Communication, Study of Cables and Its Color Codes
Objective:
To introduce Packet Tracer and its basic features.
To understand peer-to-peer communication.
To study different types of network cables and their color codes.
Materials Required:
Packet Tracer software.
Network cables (Ethernet, crossover, etc.).
Theory:
Overview of Packet Tracer: Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool that allows users to create network topologies, configure devices, and simulate packet flows.
Basics of Peer-to-Peer Communication: This involves direct communication between two devices without a centralized server, allowing for efficient data exchange.
Color Coding Standards for Network Cables:
Ethernet Cable: T568A and T568B standards.
T568A: White/Green, Green, White/Orange, Blue, White/Blue, Orange, White/Brown, Brown.
T568B: White/Orange, Orange, White/Green, Blue, White/Blue, Green, White/Brown, Brown.
Procedure:
Open Packet Tracer: Launch the software and explore its interface.
Create a Simple Network:
Drag two computers and a switch into the workspace.
Connect the computers to the switch using Ethernet cables.
Configure IP Addresses:
Click on each computer and navigate to the Desktop tab â†’ IP Configuration.
Assign the following IP addresses:
Computer 1: 192.168.1.1 (Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0)
Computer 2: 192.168.1.2 (Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0)
Test the Connection:
Open the Command Prompt on Computer 1 and use the ping command:
plaintext
Copy code
ping 192.168.1.2
Check for successful replies.
Study Network Cables:
Review the different types of cables (Ethernet, crossover) and their respective color codes.
Observations:
IP Configuration Steps:
Documented IP addresses assigned to each computer.
Ping Results:
Record successful ping results, indicating proper connectivity.
Cable Color Codes:
T568A:
White/Green, Green, White/Orange, Blue, White/Blue, Orange, White/Brown, Brown.
T568B:
White/Orange, Orange, White/Green, Blue, White/Blue, Green, White/Brown, Brown.
Conclusion:
Summarized the steps taken to create the network and configure devices.
Reflected on the importance of understanding basic networking concepts, including IP addressing and the significance of different cable types and their color codes.
